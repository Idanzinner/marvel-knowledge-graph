His unique combination of abilities - wall-crawling, super strength, agility, and spider-sense - make him an effective crime fighter. His spider-sense in particular gives him a unique advantage in detecting danger.

His divine powers make him one of the most powerful Avengers, capable of battling gods, cosmic entities, and interdimensional threats.
